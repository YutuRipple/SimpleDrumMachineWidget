# Drum Machine Widget
A responsive drum machine built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** â€” a simple yet fun audio project inspired by freeCodeCamp's Front End Development curriculum.

All drum pad sound assets are located in the `assets/sounds` folder, and can be easily replaced with your own custom audio samples if you prefer using your own local files.
